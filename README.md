## Developing a Pizza Order Form using JavaScript

### Objective

For this project, I had to learn how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript and JQuery.

The final result needed the following functionality:

* Allow the customer to select crust, sauce, cheese type, size and toppings
* Track price changes as selections were made
* Print an itemized invoice once order is placed

### Steps Taken

First I created the HTML page (adding a bit of CSS styling), I then created the logic for caluculating the price based on changes in user selection. Finally, I used a combination of JavaScript and JQuery to listen for user selections and output the itemized invoice.

### Results

Having had experience with HTML and JavaScript already made it relatively straightforward to create both the page and the logic. I was unfamiliar with DOM manipulation, though, and this project really forced me to learn both what is possible and how to make it happen!
